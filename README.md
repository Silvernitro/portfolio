# My Portfolio site

Nothing too interesting here; I originally designed and hosted my portfolio site on Wix with a custom domain but decided I didn't want to keep paying 12USD/month. So I found a few free days in the summer of 2021 to rebuild the site myself in React, following the same design from Wix. 

I'm deploying the React app with gh-pages and hosting it with GitHub Pages (free!). I'm still keeping my custom domain though: www.lausiawsam.com

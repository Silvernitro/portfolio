# My Portfolio site

Nothing too interesting here; I originally designed and hosted my portfolio site on Wix with a custom domain but decided I didn't want to keep paying 12USD/month. So I found a few free days in the summer of 2021 to rebuild the site myself in React, following the same design from Wix. 

I'm deploying the React app with gh-pages and hosting it with GitHub Pages (free!). I'll still keep my custom domain though. This isn't set up yet but I'll do it soon after fulfulling some necessary ICANN rules and transferring the CNAME record to my DNS provider.
